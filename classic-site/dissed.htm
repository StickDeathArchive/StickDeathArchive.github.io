Council.</font></big></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I have to share this with you guys....This was taken from a
newsletter distributed by the PTC <a href="http://www.parentstv.org/adboard/celebrity.asp" target="_blank">(Parents Television Council)</a>.&nbsp; In this issue, they decided to
wipe their ass on a few websites. They used a survey published in the &quot;Publisher's
weekly&quot; , and then basically just went through the websites the kids mentioned.. I am
happy to be on their list of &quot;dangerous&quot; sites. See if you can read it...it's
hilarious.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Here is the article:</font></p>

<table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><p align="center"><img src="ptc2.gif" alt="Please wait for this to load...100k" width="600" height="535"></td>
    <td width="50%" bgcolor="#000000"><p align="center"><font face="Arial">So...they list
    WWF.com, WCW.com, MTV.com, StickDeath.com, and Playboy.com....as dangerous sites.</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Arial">&quot;Appear harmless on the surface, they proved
    quite the opposite.&quot; </font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Arial">I love the blurb to the right of the
    screenshot.&quot;Remember, the sites listed are not in development; they are <em>already
    favorites </em>of teenaged Internet users.&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Arial">....oooooohhhhhhh....it's too late!</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Arial">Cracks me up. I was laughing my ass off when I saw my
    little blue dog staring at me from the screenshot. I told him to stay out of
    trouble....I'm going to have to get a leash for him.</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Arial">Thanks to James for scanning this for me!</font></p>
