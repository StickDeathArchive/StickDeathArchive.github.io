<p align="center"><font face="Arial"><span style="background-color: #0000FF">
NOTE!!!...I've been meaning to mention this. If you would like to host please 
put your city and state in the subject to make things easier to plan a logical 
tour route. THANKS!</span></font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2">UPDATE: I've 
gotten tons of requests to host the stick dude so far, and I have more to read. 
You are going to be amazed where he is headed. I have been cracking up at some 
of the plans. I wish I could go along. If you have written and I haven't 
responded, it may just be that I haven't had time to write back. I plan on 
replying to all of them. I am also making a clone, so I can send him to some of the more 
pressing places without delay. Stay tuned.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000"><b>The Idea:</b></font><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><br>
</font><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial">I am sending a real stick (a 
wooden, approx.&nbsp; 6&quot; tall figure that I will make) on 
tour of the US. I've been meaning to do this for over a year, but I am finally 
getting around to doing it. He will be going worldwide, but he will start in the 
US and go on from there.</font></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000">How?:</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FF0000"><br>
</font></b><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">He will travel from place 
to place by US mail, through hosts...you.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000"><b>What?:<br>
</b></font><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial">If you would like to host 
him for a day or two, read on for details. If not, you will be able to follow 
his travels by viewing pictures I will post from the hosts.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000"><b>Where would he like to 
visit?:<br>
</b></font><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial">I'm pretty sure he would 
like to visit any famous landmark, go to parties, baseball games, go on stage 
with bands, go on patrol with law enforcement, or hang out with a cool group of 
fans....whatever sounds good, he will be there. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000"><b>How can you be a host?<br>
</b></font><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial">To be a host you have to 
agree to a couple things, just so I can keep it going. Anyone is eligible, but 
preference will be given to people with the best plans..<br>
#1 You should be at least 18 years old. <br>
#2 You must agree to mail him to the next party (as soon as possible) as instructed 
by myself. I will not pay for shipping, but it should only cost about $2.00 (I'm 
guessing).<br>
#3 You have to agree not to deform, dismember, mutilate, or otherwise change the 
appearance of the stick, or his belongings. Nor can you fuck around and hold him 
hostage or any of that bullshit. It would not be funny, I would not use the 
pictures, and you simply would be skipped and charged a fee for the loss of my 
property (if you are lucky).<br>
#4 (removed)<br>
#5 You MUST have a digital camera, or at least an instant camera, and a scanner 
, so you can send me your pictures. <br>
#6 You must agree not to depict him doing anything that doesn't fit the SD way 
of life, or attitude. If you have to ask, forget it.<br>
#7 Nudity is allowed , for women only, and certain areas will be blurred before 
posting. <br>
#8 You will be notified by e-mail when you will be hosting. If you do not 
respond, you will be dropped from the route.<br>
#9 You must not do anything I wouldn't like , but haven't listed here. Still 
interested? Send your name, mail address, e-mail address, and your plans as a 
host to this address: <a href="mailto:sticktour@yahoo.com">
<font color="#FFFF00">StickTour@yahoo.com</font></a><font color="#FFFF00">.
</font>I am the only one who will see your information, and I will not use it 
for any other reason than to instruct the previous host where to mail him. If 
your address fits a logical route, and sounds like it would be fun....he will be 
there.<br>
#10 You must respect my property, or it will be a bummer for everyone. If 
repairs are needed, or done, I want to see it.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">To sum it up, send 
me your info, and a plan, when he arrives, show him around, take pictures, send 
me the pictures, and mail him on the the next party. PS...he likes Miller Lite.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000"><b>What do you get for being 
a host?:<br>
</b></font><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial">Same as 
me...nothing...except for the fun of being a part of this, and trying to show 
him the best time. I have a very, very&nbsp; few t-shirts in my possession, and 
whoever sends the best pictures , can have one. I can't guarantee any particular 
size, but odds are I will have it. I managed to hang on to a few for myself, but 
this will be good enough to give one up for.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000"><b>When?: <br>
</b></font><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial">He will be leaving O'hare 
airport Friday 4/19/02. I will post the photos from that on Saturday 4/20/02, 
and go on from there.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000"><b>Why?:<br>
</b></font><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial">Because I know it will be 
hilarious, and I really go out of my way to try to amuse myself.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">Any questions? You 
can send them to the sticktour address, or the gimme_metal address.</font><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><br>
