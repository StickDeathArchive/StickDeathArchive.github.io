					<p><b style="font-size: 14px">OCALA, Florida (AP) -- Two 
					boys were arrested for making pencil-and-crayon stick figure 
					drawings depicting a 10-year-old classmate being stabbed and 
					hung, police said. The children, charged with a felony, were 
					taken from school in handcuffs.</b></p>
					<p>The 9- and 10-year-old boys were arrested Monday and 
					charged with making a written threat to kill or harm another 
					person. They were also suspended from school.</p>
					<p>One drawing showed the two boys standing on either side 
					of the other boy and &quot;holding knives pointed through&quot; his 
					body, according to a police report. The figures were 
					identified by written names or initials.</p>
					<p>Another drawing showed a stick figure hanging, tears 
					falling from his eyes, with two other stick figures standing 
					below him. Other pieces of scrap paper listed misspelled 
					profanities and the initials of the boy who was allegedly 
					threatened.</p>
					<p>The boys' parents said they thought the children should 
					be punished by the school and families, not the legal 
					system.</div>
