<p><font face="Arial">Well StickDeath fans...this page is for you. My fan mail outnumbers
my hate mail by (not kidding) about 20,000(MIN) to 1. I get mail from hundreds of
countries, and most is great , but I have had hate mail from Australia, the UK,
Ireland(come on), Sweden( dude didn't even write it in English),Italy ( hey I love pizza,
thanks),Canada (Blame Canada) and other countries, but the thing that I find funny is that
I get so much mail from them saying they love it...cracks me up.&nbsp; I get a lot of fake
stuff from people hoping to see their note here...but I have a way of telling if it is
real or not...and here is some of it.</font></p>

Subject: You have to open this to see what it's about <br>
To: Rob@stickdeath.com <br>
X-Mailer: AOL 6.0 for Windows CA sub 98 </font><font lang="0" face="arial,helvetica" color="#0080ff" size="3" family="SANSSERIF"><br>
</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><font lang="0" face="arial,helvetica" family="SANSSERIF" color="#C0C0C0" size="2">Ok, it's not like i think i'm going to make any difference with
this e-mail, and i have no problem with your sense of humor or website cuz if i did, i
shouldn't be on it, right? I just want to know what's up with the comment on the
bullfighter. I mean, those are real people you're talking about there, not stickpeople so
there goes your backup with the &quot;calm down they're just animations&quot;. do you
really think that's funny? just curious though, if you died tonight, where do you think
you'd end up? </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000">My comment: Well thanks for the note. You are right,
those guys are people too. But they are also assuming the risk of being gored to death for
the glory of killing the bull. Since the guy is taking the risk, and the bull is being
killed for no reason at all...I back the bull. I HOPE the bull has little pieces of the
guys rectum hanging from his horns when it's over. By assuming the risk, I mean he knows
what he's getting into. Like the mafia, or gangs. No one really cares when those guys get
killed do they? OK...maybe their families, but they know what's up also. I shouldn't group
the mafia and gangs together, because at least when the mob decides to make a hit, they
actually get who they are going after. The gang bangers run around shooting and usually
wipe out an innocent bystander. Ideally the 2 people involved would shoot each other at
the same time, instead of missing their target and hitting a little 5 yr. old girl buying
ice cream. (happened not too far from my old house). I hope you now see the difference.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000">As for the question </font><font lang="0" face="arial,helvetica" family="SANSSERIF" color="#C0C0C0" size="2"> &quot;if you died
tonight, where do you think you'd end up?&quot; </font><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000">...I'm
not going out tonight, so if I died tonight I'd expect to end up at home. It's not like
you can die and then go out partying. And by the way....calm down, they ARE just
animations.</font></p>

<font face="Arial" size="2">Hey dude, I like your stick animations and shit but I was
reading your hate mail and I thought you were a little dry on the humor.&nbsp; Who the
fuck cares about how to spell macabre.&nbsp; If I were you I would get rid of everything
but the animations because everything but that is gay.&nbsp; Peace out dude.&nbsp; I think
some of those letters are fake.&nbsp; Nobody's that fucking stupid and nobody would put
something that was really true about their site that was detrimental on the their site.

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000">My comment: Trust me, I don't care how you spell
macabre, or anything else for that matter. But why not point out the obvious. As for this
mail page being gay... how the hell can text be gay? It can be fucking stupid, or
meaningless, I'll agree to that....but gay?....I don't think so. As for it being fake
because &quot;</font><font face="Arial" size="2">Nobody's that fucking stupid and nobody
would put something that was really true about their site that was detrimental on the
their site.&quot;</font><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000">... you must not go out much to
say nobody is &quot;that stupid&quot;. Or maybe I run into the only stupid fucks that
exist, in my daily life. Seriously...there are stupid assholes all over the place. Why
would you think they haven't been able to drop in an AOL CD and spread their stupidity to
the internet, or even to me? And I have to add....your last comment makes no sense at all.
You are telling me that I won't put comments that are detrimental to my site on my
site....and yet that is exactly what you were reading. Are you saying that this page
doesn't exist? The next time some asshole hits his breaks in the left lane on the
expressway to dial his cell phone, I'm going to think of you and your stupidpeopleless
society. You must live in a town of one, and not know yourself.</font></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial">Your site, and many people will agree with me stinks! That
art is to basic and ugly that a monkey could do it! I read your news post earlier 'you
have a business trip' to attend, what do u there eh? just sit a comfy chair drawing gay
stick figures!&nbsp; And another thing, are you too pussy to put a pic of what you look
like on the net, so we can see what kind of pysco is behind this 'masterpiece' website?</font></small></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FF0000">My comment: Too basic and ugly?....now that
is upsetting to hear....I thought it was complex and beautiful.....DAMN! The business trip
was referring to my day job. I'm sure you'll have a job someday....I can tell you are
headed for a rewarding job in the lawn care business, so I'm sure you'll do some traveling
also. As for a picture of me...here you go (I'm the one with the small ass on the right). <a href="smallass.htm" target="_self">Click Here</a></font></p>

<br>
why do you insist upon hiding yourself behind these weak, lame little<br>
cartoons? if you want to kill someone why don't you, you cowardly<br>
little bastard. even my grandma had more balls than you (bet you're<br>
going to make some snide little cutesie remark about my grandma's balls<br>
aren't you?) oh well at least she had the guts to actually kill people<br>
instead of fantasizing about it. also, she actually had sex with some<br>
one other than herself every once in a while.</font></p>

<p><br>
<font face="Arial" color="#FF0000">My Comment: I think there's a little more to the
grandma thing you don't want to talk about....isn't there....come on....it's OK....it's
not your fault....sometimes grandma's do bad things to their grandkids....That person you
were talking about in the last line....it was you... wasn't it.....it's OK...it's
OK....shhhhhh....there, there....shhhhhhhhhhhh....</font></p>

Your not funny.....and even my teenage kids think you're<br>
macrebe...I think you must have too much free time on your<br>
hands.....&quot;Stix&quot; (no pun intended)......wrote a song about<br>
that.....perhaps it was &quot;before your time&quot;......get a<br>
life......learn a sense of &quot;humor&quot;, or go AWAY!!!!</font></p>

<font face="Arial" color="#FF0000">My Comment: OK...lemme get this straight....you're (not
your...I got it) suggesting that I get a life....which, by your description, includes
listening to Stix, getting your kids opinion on my web site, and then telling ME to
&quot;go away&quot; while you're at MY web site? And also....just where do you go to
&quot;learn&quot; a sense of humor?....I guess for you, it was the same place you went to
learn how to spell macabre. I feel sorry for your kids.</font></p>

&gt;Your page has to be the most repulsive , disturbing ,obscene trash I <br>
&gt;have ever seen in my life . You obviously have a lot of free time on <br>
&gt;your hands. I suggest you get yourself some friends and a better hobby . <br>
&gt;Maybe you should see someone about this problem you have , associating <br>
&gt;stick figures with vulgar language, blood baths ,the ripping of <br>
&gt;testicles, and death . If this is your idea of a joke you have a sick <br>
&gt;sense of humor . Bloodlusting freaks like you DON'T BELONG ON THE <br>
&gt;INTERNET . </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000">My comment: Hmmmmm....a better
hobby.....hmmmm.....I GOT IT ! .... I'll start a porn site!&nbsp; THEN will I belong on
the internet? Excuse me Mr. &quot;Internet cop&quot;...yes you... all white knuckled with
your hand wrapped around your mouse....the so called &quot;blood&quot; you refer to is
digital...not real, like the blood I was watching on a shock video show, shown on <strong>network
television</strong> tonight. Dine on my unit....and then surf your ass outta here.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000"><small>(By the way, if any of you saw
the show I was reffering to (2/4/99)....did you laugh your ass off like I did when the
bull kicked that bullfighters ass and gored him in the neck?!... HA! They stick those
spear-like things into the bull and then stand there all tight-assed like they did
something brave or something... I love it when the bull flips them around like the pussies
they are. If only the bull would have better aim and gore him through his head !....please
keep those video cameras rolling!....I wanna see it ! )</small></font></p>

ROB MAN, WHATS WITH YOUR FUCKIN GAY ASS SITE YOU WANKER. <br>
YOU MUST SPEND ALL DAY ON IT YOU COMPUTER NERD.<br>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000">My comment: Ahhhh yes...hotmail...you have to love
those free e-mail services. Well, dork...all I can say is if I did spend all day on my
site it would be A LOT better. You think it takes me so long, because in order for you to
do the same with your damaged brain, you need Mommy to move the mouse for you and type. Am
I close? I know it's frustrating...ask her to put a beer in your spill-less cup with the
BIG handle, and take it easy. </font></p>

You suck . Why do you think this is funny. I hope something like that happens to YOU. Then
you won't think it's so funny.</p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000">My comment: If it happens to me...I hope it's
something funny. I hope someone good does the animation.&nbsp; I mean really , If it's
your time, usually you don't have a choice...but if I did...yes, I would hope it was funny
for others to chuckle at, rather than something boring.</font></p>
