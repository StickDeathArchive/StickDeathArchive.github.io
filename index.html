                <p>This site aims to archive as many of the original StickDeath.com games and animations as possible!</p>
				<p>Unfortunately, StickDeath.com is gone and it has been excluded from the Internet Archive for reasons unknown. This site aims to host as many of the original StickDeath swf files as possible; but we need your help! While we scoured the internet and managed to recover a good chunk of the original swf files, many more are missing! If you have them, know someone who has them, or have found them, please contact us! We want to build as complete of an archive as possible!</p>
				<p>Check the list of animations and games and see if you have any that we don't! If you do, please email the missing animations and/or games to <strong>stickdeatharchive@gmail.com</strong>.</p>
